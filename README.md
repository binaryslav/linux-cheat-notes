# linux-cheat-notes
A collection of some useful commands that I use in my daily work.
I'm here to simplify someone else's workflow as it works for me.
Please, read Usage Guidlines first

Usage Guidlines: 
 * Use a content list for quick navigation through the document(hint: Ctrl + F --> *case sensetive search* to jump directly)
 * Commands in chapters aren't sorted and may surprise you being placed into a chapter you weren't expected them to be.
 * Feel free to help me to improve my notes with new commands or interesting usage examples.
 
Thank you for reading and happy coding !

# linux-cheat-notes
A collection of some useful Shell commands and expressions that I use in my daily work.

   It was composed with a fuzzy-find-friendliness in mind and one can make the most out of it by:
   
      1. Using any fuzzy finding engine of your choice(namely, Telescope)
      2. Using a built-in search for IDEs(eg VS ****, JetBrains, Atom etc)
      3. Simply doing it like a CLI ninja:

```Bash
 cat linux-cheat-notes.md | less;
//or
 cat linux-cheat-notes.md | grep "pattern";
//etc
```
==Patterns== to jump around faster <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  "<<0"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      - back to contents(obsolete with Vim motions in play)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  "<<[1-10]" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- between chapters<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  "- text"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   - search by description of a command<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  "keyword" &nbsp; - by command-specific keywords<br>
   
## ! NOTE:
   
   Commands in chapters aren't sorted alphabetically(yet);
   I will cosider investing my time in making it command-line-friendly in the future.

## TODO:
- [ ] sort it alphabetically
- [ ] work around unix CLI compatability


*Happy coding !*

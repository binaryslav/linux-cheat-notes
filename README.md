# linux-cheat-notes
A collection of some useful commands that I use in my daily work.

Usage: 
 * Use a list of content for quick navigation through the document(meant to be used: Ctrl + F --> *case sensetive search* to jump directly)
 
 ! NOTE: Commands in chapters aren't sorted and may surprise you being placed into a chapter you weren't expected them to be.

Thank you for reading and happy coding !

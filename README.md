# linux-cheat-notes
A collection of some useful Linux commands that I use in my daily work.

Usage: 

   Navigation is done typically by jumping to a specific line either with help of built-in search(Ctrl + F) in most modern text editors like VS Code/Codium, Sublime etc or by clicking on a link from "Contents". In its current state it's barely useful for console ninjas so there's not much you can do about it, except for:

```Bash
 cat linux-cheat-notes.md | grep "pattern";
//or 
 cat linux-cheat-notes.md | less;
```
 
! Note:
   Commands in chapters aren't sorted alphabetically(yet);
   I will cosider investing my time in making it command-line-friendly in the future.

- [ ] sort it alphabetically
- [ ] work around unix CLI compatability


Happy coding !
